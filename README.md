# Kuda Mobile App
Kuda bank is a fintech bank that allow users to seamlessly do transactions without charges, amazing right ?.

The bank doesn't have branches like other commercial banks, every services is done on the app, I mean everything you either walk in or do online with commercial banks is done on Kuda app. I and my team was curious how monetary operations can be done seamlessly without human interaction. 

I tested the onboarding part of the app from downloading to filling customer profile, performed KYC, send money to other banks, receive money from other banks and pay utility bills.

Even though its a app, the customer service experience was topnotch and all passed test.
